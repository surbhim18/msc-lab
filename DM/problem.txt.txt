1. Generate 5 random numbers between [50, 100] . These will be the cluster sizes.

2. Generate bi-variate data from three variations of Gaussian distribution, uniform distribution and exponential distribution as discussed in class. Use the cluster sizes as in step1. (I mentioned univariate in class, but now I am saying bivariate.)
 
3. Assign class  labels 1-5 to the points and  Merge all the data points. Plot these where the five clusters are clearly separated. If they are not, adjust the parameters of the distributions to get the clusters separated. Each label should be one color.

4. Apply kmeans, hierarchical clustering and DBScan on the dataset separately, and plot clusters for each clustering scheme. (each cluster in different color).
The number of cluster for DBScan may be different from 5.

5. For each scheme, find Purity and SSE and print on the plots.

6. Make sure that the legend is there on the graph. (Each cluster should have different symbol).

7. Write one page description of the observations, and compile the report with compete details of data generation,  and plots.

8. Email the report before the deadline.

-------------
1. Check density plots to see if distributions are correct. -- not possible with bivariate data
2. Write all points in files when done. create another script that just uses them.
